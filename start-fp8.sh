# start-fp8.sh — Same 2-node vLLM launch as start.sh, but serve
#                 Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 instead of NVFP4.
#
# Official FP8 is fine-grained (block-128) over the whole checkpoint, so the
# NVFP4 PLE resolver shim is not applied. Context is native 262144 (no YaRN):
# FP8 weights leave too little KV for 1M on this 2×Spark kit (available KV
# cache is around 500k tokens, not the ~3.65M of nvidia NVFP4 with fp8 KV).
#
# Weights stay on the head HuggingFace cache and are exported over NFS
# (ConnectX) — the worker does not download or rsync a local copy.
#
# Cluster IPs, TP/EP/MTP, image, NFS, and ports still come from .env.
#
# Usage: same flags as start.sh
#   ./start-fp8.sh
#   ./start-fp8.sh --no-download
#   ./start-fp8.sh --launch
